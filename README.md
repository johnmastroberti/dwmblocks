# dwmblocks
Modular status bar for dwm written in c.
# modifying blocks
The statusbar is made from text output from commandline programs.
Blocks are added and removed by editing the blocks.h header file.

# My changes
This is a fork of Luke Smith's dwmblocks, with added support for the status2d patch.  Each block in the statusbar is given a color pulled from Xresources.
